  - What are you doing in here?
  - 'Surely you can find better things to do with your time. '
  - Actually something has come to my attention, somebody may need your help.
  - Chances are you've seen that villager frantically roaming around the island.
  - I passed him this afternoon and he mentioned there was something dangerous in
    the area.
  - He could be hallucinating for all I know. However, desolate times often bring
    out the worst in people. Be prepared.
